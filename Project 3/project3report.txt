Step 5:
I input negative integers such as -50 for those who voted for the Republican Party and entered the same integer but positive (so 50 for those who voted for the Democratic Party). 


This meant that the overall number of electors would be 0. In doing so, this resulted in “inf%” for the percentage of democratic and republican voters.


logic_error.cpp:
Line 6: change 100 to 1000


This means that even if the Republican party wins or if there is a tie, the result will always be that the Democratic party wins. If there are 50 electors and 25 vote for the Republican party and 25 vote for the Democratic party, 50% will show as the percentage of voters who were Republican while 500% will show as the percentage of voters who were Democratic, leading to a Democratic win.


Compile_error.cpp:
Line 22: removed “;”
Line 32: changed “cint >>” to “cint <<”


The build failed as the compiler reported an expected “;” after the expression as well as invalid operands to the binary expression
